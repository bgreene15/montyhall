Description: Provides functions to simulate the Monty Hall Game. The game replicates the game on the TV show "Let's Make a Deal" where there are three doors for a contestant to choose from, one of which has a car behind it and two have goats. The contestant selects a door, then the host opens a door to reveal a goat, and then the contestant is given an opportunity to stay with their original selection or switch to the other unopened door. This package runs large simulations to explore the probabilities behind choosing to stay or switch from the initial door choice.
